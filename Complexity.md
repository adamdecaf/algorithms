# Algorithmic Complexity

Complexity of algorithms is a real world problem. Being able to understand and
manage resources being used (processor cycles, memory, disk access, etc..) and
algorithms which use less resources or take less time are better. They're more
practical and feasible for users of these algorithms.

## Non Time/Space Constraints

Sometimes time or space are not the resources being constrained. Maybe it's
dollars to fund the computers running, or the number of colors used to color a
map.

## Definitions

* Big O: `O(n)` -- upper bound lead term of a function of the input.
* Big Omega `Ω(n)`  -- lower bound lead term of a function of the input.
* Big Theta `Θ(n)` -- Average bound lead term of a function of the input.
