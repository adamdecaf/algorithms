# Sorting

## Selection Sort

repeatedly select the smallest element in the list in slots [i, n] and
put it in slot i, and increment i.

### Notes

* After k iterations, the smallest k items are in slots [1..k].

## Insertion Sort

repeatedly select the next element and find the index where it is now
the largest element in the sorted sub-list and insert it there.
