## Tasks

1. Given two sorted lists of values, we would like to find the list of common elements, also sorted. For example, given [2, 2, 3, 7] and [2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7], the list of common elements is [2, 3, 7].

In Session 4, we saw one algorithm for solving this problem.

  * Design either a new top-down algorithm or a new bottom-up algorithm to solve this problem.
  * Explain why your algorithm is top-down or bottom-up.
  * Let m and n be the lengths of the input lists. State the maximum number of comparisons that your algorithm makes in terms of m and n.

2. Consider the Comparison Counting Sort algorithm below, which appears in Levitin's text. Given an unsorted array of values, it produces a new, sorted array. It does so by counting for each item v the number of items in the array that are less than v, and using that information to put v in its appropriate spot.

  * Demonstrate how this algorithm operates on this input array: [93, 13, 37, 14].
  * Explain why this algorithm is (or isn't) stable.
  * Explain why this algorithm is (or isn't) in-place.

3. Read the first two paragraphs of the section labeled What is a patent? on US Patent and Trademark Office's patents web page.

Should the inventor of an algorithm be eligible to receive a utility patent? Why, or why not? (Limit yourself to three to five sentences.)
