# Basics

## What is an Algorithm?

"An Algorithm is a well-defined set of instructions for solving a problem."

There are three basic types of algorithms: `Top-Down`, `Bottom-Up`, and `Zoom-In`.

## Top-Down

Top-Down algorithms force you to start at the end goal, e.g. make an ecommerce
application and to break it down into each of its parts. (Auth, Credit Card
processing, item listing / sorting, etc..)

## Bottom-Up

Bottom-Up algorithms turn Top-Down algorithms on their head. They would start
with building each of the parts and then bringing them together.

## Zoom-In

Zoom-In algorithms are those which allow the problem space to be minified or
reduced to a solution that will statisfy the end goal.
