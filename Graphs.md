# Graphs

Recall, `G = (V, E)`. One set of nodes (Vertexes) and a set of edges.

If E contains ordered pairs, the graph is directional. Otherwise the
graph is an undirected graph.

## Terms

* Complete - an edge between any two nodes
* Dense - Not required to be a complete graph, but many edges exist.
  * `0 << |V|^2`
* Sparse - Not a complete graph, and there are not many edges between nodes.
  * `0 < |V|^2`
* Weighted and unweighted edges. Each edge has a value associated to it.
* Connected and disconnected nodes. IFF a graph is connected then paths
  exist between all edges.
* Labeled vs unlabled (generalized version of weight).
* Paths or Cycles
* Degree of a vertex is the number of edges that emanate from it.
